# DevCon2017-Breakout-JS
Code used in the JavaScript demo of my presentation on game development at [Developers Conference 2017](https://conference.mscc.mu)

The code is annotated with my comments for easier understanding while viewing. It is based on the Mozilla Developer Network tutorial [2D breakout game using pure JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).
